# spiking_neural_networks
An implementation of Izhikevich's model of a spiking neuron

Model: http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/communicationwithearth/data/

My implementation is a parallelised version in C of the model above. It runs a bunch of 'neurons' but they don't do much except firing at random. I guess you could plug in some form of input, output and back-propagation training.
