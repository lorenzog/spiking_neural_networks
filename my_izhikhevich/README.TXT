How to use my Izhikevich's implementation:

To compile, launch 

make

this will create an Intel-optimised 'OpenMP' executable (named myIzhik-omp) and a non-parallelised version (named myIzhik-nonomp). 

The Makefile should be optimised to run on OSX. To run it on linux, follow the instructions inside the file (i.e. OSX has different INCLUDE directories and GCC compiler)

There is a small script to be run on the cluster, that tries several Izhikevich networks with the parallelised and the non-parallelised version. To run everything on the cluster, launch the following command:

./runCluster.sh bench.sh

this will go into my own directory on the cluster and run the executable 'bench.sh' which in turn is a shell script that launches the benchmark. 

Note that the 'bench.sh' script will save the benchmarking data in two files, namely

bench-omp.txt
bench-nonomp.txt

if the files already exist it won't run. You need to delete or move the files away before running the script.

To compare the differences and the timing, run the compare_bench.m matlab script. It will load the 'bench-omp.txt' and 'bench-nonomp.txt' files and display the running times.

The executable file can also be ran on the command line. If you run it as

./myIzhik-omp

it will, by default, run a 1000-neuron spiking neural network with 800 excitatory and 200 inhibitory neurons for 1 second with the random seed '42', and it will save the firings in a random filename (displayed at the end of the execution). It will also display the command-line parameters options to run it. 

Usage: ./myIzhik-omp
options:
-s <random seed> 
-t <simulation time> 
-f <output file> 
-e <excitatory neurones> 
-i <inhibitory neurones> 
-h (this help)

Note that, in order NOT to save any firings data (those files can become very very large), you should use the option -f /dev/null. Look at the file bench.sh to see an example of some command-line parameters.

Other files:

In the directory there are other files:

izhik_orig.m

This is the original Izhikevich's implementation of 1000 firing neurons. It is used to run comparison with the results generated by the C code. 

compare_results.m

This file runs the original Izhikevich implementation, loads the firing data from it and compares it with the firing data generated by the C version. In order to obtain the firing data, you need to run it as

./myIzhik-omp -f firings.dat

so it will generate the 'firings.dat' file. 

myIzhik_gsl.c

This file is an old version which implements GSL (Gnu Scientific Library) calls. It is no longer maintained.

simulation-20090823.tar.gz

An example of a simulation run. It contains two results file from the benchmark comparison and an image of the comparison graph.

The source code is pretty straightforward. It's probably very ugly, it does its
job, it's well commented and the results are sound.

Izhikevich's neurons implementation starts around line 213, i.e. the main 'for'
loop.
